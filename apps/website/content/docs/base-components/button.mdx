## Overview

The Button component is a fundamental UI element for triggering actions. It supports
multiple visual styles, sizes, loading states, and icon placement. Built on top of
Ark UI's factory function, it provides native button accessibility out of the box.

## Variants

The Button component supports seven visual variants:

- **primary**: Main action button with brand color background
- **secondary**: Secondary action with subtle background and border
- **tertiary**: Tertiary action with tertiary text color and hover background
- **outline**: Outlined button with transparent background
- **ghost**: Minimal button with no background, only text
- **destructive**: For destructive actions (delete, remove)
- **link**: Text button styled as a link

## Sizes

The Button component supports four sizes:

- **sm**: Small button (height: 32px)
- **md**: Medium button (height: 36px) - default
- **lg**: Large button (height: 40px)
- **xl**: Extra large button (height: 44px)

## Features

- **Icons**: Support for leading and trailing icons
- **Loading State**: Built-in loading spinner with optional loading text
- **Disabled State**: Proper disabled styling and behavior
- **Accessibility**: Full keyboard navigation and ARIA support via Ark UI
- **Customizable**: All styles can be overridden via `className` prop

## Select Examples

### Primary

Primary variant buttons are used for main actions. They feature a brand color background and are the most prominent buttons in the interface.

<ComponentPreview name="button" example="button-primary" />

<Divider className="my-12" />

### Secondary

Secondary variant buttons are used for secondary actions. They have a subtle background and border, providing a less prominent alternative to primary buttons.

<ComponentPreview name="button" example="button-secondary" />

<Divider className="my-12" />

### Tertiary

Tertiary variant buttons use tertiary text colors and show a background on hover. They're useful for less prominent actions that still need to be visible.

<ComponentPreview name="button" example="button-tertiary" />

<Divider className="my-12" />

### Outline

Outline variant buttons have a transparent background with a border. They're useful for actions that need to be visible but less prominent than primary or secondary buttons.

<ComponentPreview name="button" example="button-outline" />

<Divider className="my-12" />

### Ghost

Ghost variant buttons have no background and minimal styling. They're ideal for subtle actions or when you want the button to blend into the interface.

<ComponentPreview name="button" example="button-ghost" />

<Divider className="my-12" />

### Destructive

Destructive variant buttons are used for dangerous or irreversible actions like deleting or removing content. They use error colors to indicate the severity of the action.

<ComponentPreview name="button" example="button-destructive" />

<Divider className="my-12" />

### Link

Link variant buttons are styled as text links with underline on hover. They're useful for navigation or less prominent actions.

<ComponentPreview name="button" example="button-link" />

<Divider className="my-12" />

### With Icons

Buttons can include icons before or after the text, or both. Icons help communicate the action more clearly and improve visual hierarchy.

<ComponentPreview name="button" example="button-with-icons" />

<Divider className="my-12" />

### Loading

Buttons support loading states with a spinner. You can show the loading spinner alone or keep the text visible while loading.

<ComponentPreview name="button" example="button-loading" />

<Divider className="my-12" />

### Sizes

Buttons come in four sizes: small (sm), medium (md), large (lg), and extra large (xl). Choose the size that best fits your interface and action importance.
