## Overview

The Accordion component allows users to toggle the display of sections of content. It's built with Ark UI primitives and styled with Tailwind CSS for a modern, accessible experience.

## Anatomy

The accordion consists of the following parts:

- **root**: The main container wrapping all accordion items
- **item**: An individual collapsible section
- **item trigger**: The clickable header that toggles the item's visibility
- **item indicator**: The icon (typically a chevron) that shows the open/closed state
- **item content**: The collapsible content area that expands and collapses

## Examples

### Multiple Items Open

Set `multiple={true}` to allow multiple items to be open simultaneously.

<ComponentPreview name="accordion" example="accordion-multiple" />

<Divider className="my-12" />

### Collapsible

Use the `collapsible` prop to allow the user to collapse all panels.

<ComponentPreview name="accordion" example="accordion-collapsible" />

<Divider className="my-12" />

### With Loader Icon

Add an animated loader icon to indicate active accordion items. The loader spins infinitely when an item is open and displays in a theme-aware color (white/black based on theme). When closed, it shows in a muted grayish color.

<Divider className="my-12" />

### With Plus/Minus Icons

Display Plus and Minus icons from lucide-react to indicate the accordion state. The Plus icon appears when an item is closed, and the Minus icon appears when an item is open. Both icons are positioned on the left side of the title, with a chevron icon on the right side.

### FAQ with Icons

A FAQ-style accordion with contextual icons for each item. Each accordion item features a left icon representing the topic, Plus/Minus icons on the right to indicate state, and a smooth hover effect on the trigger. The container has a subtle background with rounded corners.
