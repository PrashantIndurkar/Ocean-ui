## Overview

The Accordion component allows users to toggle the display of sections of content. It's built with Ark UI primitives and styled with Tailwind CSS for a modern, accessible experience.

## Anatomy

The accordion consists of the following parts:

- **root**: The main container wrapping all accordion items
- **item**: An individual collapsible section
- **item trigger**: The clickable header that toggles the item's visibility
- **item indicator**: The icon (typically a chevron) that shows the open/closed state
- **item content**: The collapsible content area that expands and collapses

## Examples

### Multiple Items Open

Set `multiple={true}` to allow multiple items to be open simultaneously.

<ComponentPreview name="accordion" example="accordion-multiple" />

<Divider className="my-12" />

### Collapsible

Use the `collapsible` prop to allow the user to collapse all panels.

<ComponentPreview name="accordion" example="accordion-collapsible" />

<Divider className="my-12" />

### With Loader Icon

Add an animated loader icon to indicate active accordion items. The loader spins infinitely when an item is open and displays in a theme-aware color (white/black based on theme). When closed, it shows in a muted grayish color.
